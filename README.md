Learning assistant app!

In order to obtain a local copy of this app via command line you must "clone" the repo.

To do this on Mac or Linux, open terminal, "cd" into the directory you wish to save the project to and run:

git clone https://github.com/chrpham/cs151.git

Git will download a copy the repo into a folder "cs151" on your local machine.

To do this on Windows, either download Git Bash and then do the above commands, or download a graphical Git program and follow the steps there.
